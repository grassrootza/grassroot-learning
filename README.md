# grassroot-learning
Machine learning components (some WIP) of Grassroot platform
The date/time parser is made with a custom-trained version of Stanford NLP's Named Entity Recognizer and Stanford NLP's SUTime. It is trained to recognize most misspelled and/or malformed inputs and convert them into a LocalDateTime object used in the Grassroot platform.
